<p id="forumstext1">As most of you are aware, the wild update was released a couple of days ago, and the community’s reaction to it, was disappointed – at best. Now, if you are anything like me, then you’ll want to try the update for yourself before forming an actual opinion, which is what I am going to be helping you do today, by showing you all how to setup your very own 1.19 Minecraft Server on your computer.</p>
<p id="forumstext2"> The first thing that you need to do when setting up a 1.19 server is to install Java onto your computer. Navigate to the first page in the video description, where you’ll be taken to a page that looks something like this. From here, you’ll want to scroll down until you see “windows x64 installer”, where you’ll download it by pressing on the link right here.</p>
